# Welcome!

PWN Protocol is a trustless and permissionless set of smart contracts. With PWN you can **use any token as collateral, invest in fixed-interest loans, and enjoy predictable returns, all without price-based liquidation risk**. In this developer documentation, you can learn about the Core contracts, protocol architecture, PWN DAO, libraries and tools we've developed.

## Documentation structure

* [**Core**](smart-contracts/core/): Learn about the Core smart contracts that make up the PWN Protocol
* [**PWN DAO**](smart-contracts/pwn-dao/): Our governance structure
* [**Tools**](smart-contracts/tools/): Tools that enhance the possibilities of PWN
* [**Libraries**](smart-contracts/libraries/): Various libraries we have developed to use (not only) in PWN
