# PWN LOAN

## 1. Summary

PWN LOAN is a PWN contextual extension of a standard [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) token. **Each LOAN is defined as an ERC-1155 NFT**. The PWN LOAN contract allows for reading the contextual information of the loans (like status, expirations, etc.) but **all of its contract features can only be called through the** [**PWN**](pwn/) **contract.**

## 3. Contract Details

* _PWNLOAN.sol_ contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.4

### LOAN token lifecycle

The PWN LOAN token is a tokenized representation of a loan that can aquire different states:

* **Dead/None** - Loan is not created or has been claimed and can be burned.
* **Running** - Loan is created by passing offer data and offer signature signed by a lender.
* **Paid back** - Loan has been fully paid back before the expiration date. The LOAN owner is able to claim lent credit + interest.
* **Expired** - Loan had not been fully paid back before expiration date. LOAN owner is able to claim collateral.

### Loan token struct

Each LOAN token is defined by the LOAN token struct.&#x20;

**`LOAN`** token struct has the following properties:

<table><thead><tr><th width="150">Type</th><th width="150">Name</th><th>Comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>uint8</code></td><td><code>status</code></td><td>see <a href="pwn-loan.md#loan-token-lifecycle">LOAN token lifecycle</a></td></tr><tr><td><code>address</code></td><td><code>borrower</code></td><td>Address of the borrower - stays the same for entire lifespan of the token</td></tr><tr><td><code>uint32</code></td><td><code>duration</code></td><td>Loan duration in seconds</td></tr><tr><td><code>uint40</code></td><td><code>expiration</code></td><td>Unix timestamp (in seconds) setting up the default deadline</td></tr><tr><td><code>MultiToken.Asset</code> (see <a href="../../smart-contracts/libraries/multitoken.md#asset-struct">Asset struct</a>)</td><td><code>collateral</code></td><td>Asset used as a loan collateral. Consisting of another <code>Asset</code> struct defined in the MultiToken library</td></tr><tr><td><code>MultiToken.Asset</code> (see <a href="../../smart-contracts/libraries/multitoken.md#asset-struct">Asset struct</a>)</td><td><code>asset</code></td><td>Asset to be borrowed by lender to borrower. Consisting of another <code>Asset</code> struct defined in the MultiToken library</td></tr><tr><td><code>uint256</code></td><td><code>loanRepayAmount</code></td><td>Amount of LOAN asset to be repaid</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Functions

This contract inherits from the ERC-1155 token standard. This comes with all of the ERC-1155 functionalities like transfers etc. Please read the [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) specification for more details.&#x20;

### View functions

Functions that don't modify the state of the contract. These functions are used to get information about the LOAN token.

#### `getStatus`

Returns LOAN status number. To understand what different status means please refer to [state diagram](pwn-loan.md#state-diagram) above.

This function takes one argument:

* `uint256`**`_loanId`** - Loan id

#### `getExpiration`

Returns the exact expiration time of a particular LOAN as a unix timestamp in seconds.&#x20;

This function takes one argument:

* `uint256`**`_loanId`** - Loan id

#### `getDuration`

Returns loan duration period of particular LOAN in seconds.&#x20;

This function takes one argument:

* `uint256`**`_loanId`** - Loan id

#### `getBorrower`

Returns borrower address of particular LOAN.

This function takes one argument:

* `uint256`**`_loanId`** - Loan id

#### `getCollateral`

Returns collateral asset of a particular LOAN. By asset we mean Asset struct described in [MultiToken](../../smart-contracts/libraries/multitoken.md).

This function takes one argument:

* `uint256`**`_loanId`** - Loan id

#### `getLoanAsset`

Returns loan asset of particular LOAN. By asset we mean Asset struct described in [MultiToken](../../smart-contracts/libraries/multitoken.md).

#### `isRevoked`

Utility function to find out if offer is revoked. Returns a boolean.&#x20;

This function takes one argument:

* `bytes32`**`_offerHash`** - Hash of the offer struct

### Events

PWNLOAN contract defines four events and no custom errors.&#x20;

```solidity
event LOANCreated(uint256 indexed loanId, address indexed lender, bytes32 indexed offerHash);
event OfferRevoked(bytes32 indexed offerHash);
event PaidBack(uint256 loanId);
event LOANClaimed(uint256 loanId);
```

### `LOANCreated`

LOANCreated event is emitted when a borrower accepts an offer.&#x20;

This event has three parameters:

* `uint256 indexed`**`loanId`** - The ID of the LOAN token
* `address indexed`**`lender`** - Address of the lender
* `bytes32 indexed`**`offerHash`** - [EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) computed [hash](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/hashing/#TypedDataEncoder-hash) of the offer struct

### `OfferRevoked`

OfferRevoked event is emitted when a lender decides to revoke an offer.&#x20;

This event has one parameter:

* `bytes32 indexed`**`offerHash`** - [EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) computed [hash](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/hashing/#TypedDataEncoder-hash) of the offer struct

### `PaidBack`

PaidBack event is emitted when a borrower repays a loan.&#x20;

This event has one parameter:

* `uint256`**`loanId`** - The ID of the LOAN token

:::info
Lenders can listen to this event to get notified when their loan has been paid back.&#x20;
:::

### `LOANClaimed`

LOANClaimed event is emitted when a lender claims the repaid amount or loan underlying collateral in case of a default.&#x20;

This event has one parameter:

* `uint256`**`loanId`** - The ID of the LOAN token
