# Using PWN without front-end

**PWN Protocol can be used without a front-end** like the PWN Platform. Please refer to the [Developer Documentation](../) you're reading right now to learn everything you need to know before interacting with the PWN protocol.\
\
**We recommend Cast** as the go-to CLI tool. Read more information about Cast in the [Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/index.html).
