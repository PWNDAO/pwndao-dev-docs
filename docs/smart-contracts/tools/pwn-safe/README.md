# PWN Safe

PWN Safe is a set of smart contracts which allow the **tokenization of&#x20;**_**Asset Transfer Rights** (ATR)_. The ATR token can then be used as collateral in lending protocols like PWN instead of the actual asset itself. The contracts leverage the composability of the Gnosis Safe contracts by extending them with a module and a guard. Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet â€” this documentation will guide you through all the details of the PWN Safe contracts.

#### **The documentation is divided into three parts:**&#x20;

* [**Architecture overview**](architecture.md): A high-level look at the contract architecture
* [**Security considerations**](security-considerations.md): Let's talk about vulnerabilities to be aware of
* [**Smart contract reference**](smart-contract-reference/atr-module/README.md): A detailed description of each contract
